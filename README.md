# Hey there! 👋 I'm Devon

Full-stack developer and problem solver. I build applications that create real impact—whether it's data-driven tools, interactive visualizations, or systems that help users work smarter.

## What I'm About 💻

I'm passionate about **building software that actually matters**. Code that solves real problems, handles complex data, and creates genuine value for users. I love tackling challenges that require both technical depth and creative thinking—from low-level graphics programming to full-stack web development.

Currently pursuing my **BS in Biology** with a **minor in Computer Science** at the University of Houston (graduating Dec 2025). My unique background gives me an edge in data analysis, scientific computing, and building applications for research-heavy domains, but I'm equally passionate about pure software engineering.

## What I've Built 🚀

**Full-Stack Development:**
- **Job Tracker Web App** - PostgreSQL-backed application with complex SQL queries, normalized database architecture, REST APIs, and dynamic templating. Handles multi-table JOINs, data filtering, and trend analysis
- **Room Designer** - Full authentication system with session management, user-specific data storage, and shareable project links. Built with Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL
- **NASA Gallery Viewer** - Integrated external APIs for real-time data visualization, implemented asynchronous programming for daily updates, and transformed JSON responses into clean, accessible UI

**Low-Level Programming:**
- **3D Game Engine (Ongoing)** - Building a graphics engine from scratch in C++ using OpenGL. Custom rendering pipeline with VBOs, VAOs, GLSL shaders, real-time lighting, and interactive camera controls. Learning GPU-based rendering, memory management, and modular architecture design

**Data & Research Tools:**
- **Genetic Analysis Pipeline** - Automated data processing workflows using Python and R for statistical analysis, data visualization, and pattern recognition in large datasets
- **Protein Crystallization Analysis** - Built data analysis tools for experimental research, working with complex datasets and multi-variable optimization

**Hackathon Experience:**
- Led database development at UH hackathon in Agile team environment, implementing secure storage, optimized queries, and real-time data manipulation

## Tech Stack 🛠️

**Languages:** C++, Python, JavaScript, SQL, HTML/CSS  
**Backend & Data:** Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, REST APIs  
**Frontend:** React.js, EJS, responsive design  
**Tools & Practices:** Git/GitHub, Linux, OpenGL, Agile development, database design, API integration, version control  
**Currently Learning:** Advanced graphics programming, distributed systems, cloud architecture (Azure)

## What Drives Me 🎯

I'm drawn to projects that involve **complex problem-solving**, whether that's optimizing database queries, building rendering pipelines, or architecting scalable systems. I especially love:
- Working with **data at scale** and making it meaningful
- **Low-level programming** and understanding how things work under the hood
- **Full-stack challenges** that require thinking about the entire system
- Building tools that genuinely improve how people work

Always looking for opportunities to grow as a developer and work on challenging problems. Open to collaborating on interesting projects—especially anything involving graphics, data visualization, or systems that need to handle complex information.
