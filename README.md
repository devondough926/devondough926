## What I'm About 💻

I'm passionate about **building software that actually matters**. Code that solves real problems, handles complex data, and creates genuine value for users. I love tackling challenges that require both technical depth and creative thinking—from low-level graphics programming to full-stack web development.

Currently pursuing my **BS in Biology** with a **minor in Computer Science** at the University of Houston (graduating Dec 2025). My unique background gives me an edge in data analysis, scientific computing, and building applications for research-heavy domains, but I'm equally passionate about pure software engineering.

## What Drives Me 🎯

I'm drawn to projects that involve **complex problem-solving**, whether that's optimizing database queries, building rendering pipelines, or architecting scalable systems. I especially love:

- Working with **data at scale** and making it meaningful
- **Low-level programming** and understanding how things work under the hood
- **Full-stack challenges** that require thinking about the entire system
- Building tools that genuinely improve how people work

Always looking for opportunities to grow as a developer and work on challenging problems. Open to collaborating on interesting projects, especially anything involving data visualization or systems that need to handle complex information.
